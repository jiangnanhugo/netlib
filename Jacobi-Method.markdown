The Jacobi method is easily derived by examining each of the  equations in the linear system  in isolation. If in the th equation



we solve for the value of  while assuming the other entries of  remain fixed, we obtain

 

This suggests an iterative method defined by

 

which is the Jacobi method. Note that the order in which the equations are examined is irrelevant, since the Jacobi method treats them independently. For this reason, the Jacobi method is also known as the method of simultaneous displacements, since the updates could in principle be done simultaneously.

Simultaneous displacements, method of: Jacobi method.

In matrix terms, the definition of the Jacobi method in (gif) can be expressed as
